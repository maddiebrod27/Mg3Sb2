# Mg3Sb2
tight-binding code for Mg3Sb2 paper

This repo contains the code used to calculate the tight-binding Hamiltonian for a toy model that represents Mg3Sb2.

Use the function calc_hamil to calculate the Hamiltonian at a given k-point (make sure that your k-point is already multiplied by 2*pi, as this is not done within the function).

Modify the dictionary containing the tight-binding interaction (hopping) parameters in order to change the interaction strengths.
